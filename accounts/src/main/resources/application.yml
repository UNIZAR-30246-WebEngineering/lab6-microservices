spring:
  application:
    # This name is crucial! It's used for:
    # 1. Service registration: Eureka registers this service as "ACCOUNTS-SERVICE"
    # 2. Configuration lookup: Config Server looks for "accounts-service.yml"
    # 3. Service discovery: Other services find this service by this name
    name: accounts-service

    config:
      # Direct URL to Config Server.
      uri: http://localhost:8762
  config:
    # Imports configuration from the Config Server.
    # WITHOUT "optional:" prefix = FAIL-FAST behavior (service fails if Config Server unreachable)
    # WITH "optional:" prefix = service starts anyway using local config
    # Note: spring.cloud.config.fail-fast is IGNORED when using spring.config.import

      # Eureka Server location. This service will:
      # 1. Register itself with Eureka at startup
      # 2. Send heartbeats every 30 seconds (default)
      # 3. Query Eureka to discover other services (like Config Server)
      # If Eureka is unavailable, the service will still start but won't
      # be discoverable by other services.
